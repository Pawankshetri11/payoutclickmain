# Earnings System Update

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Earnings Flow (CRITICAL FIX)
**Before:** Money was credited directly to balance immediately
**Now:** Proper earnings flow implemented:
- ✅ Tasks approved → Add to today/week/month earnings
- ✅ Balance = Previous months' earnings only
- ✅ Current month earnings visible but NOT yet in balance
- ✅ Earnings transfer to balance on the 1st of next month automatically
- ✅ Withdrawals available from 26-31 of each month

### 2. Image Task Verification
**Fixed:** Image tasks now work properly:
- Code verification no longer credits immediately for image tasks
- For image tasks: Code verified → Upload image → Admin approves → Earnings credited
- For code-only tasks: Code verified → Earnings credited immediately

### 3. Task Stats Display
**Fixed:** Job view page now shows real-time stats:
- Earnings from specific job
- Tasks completed count
- Total earnings across all jobs

## Important: Run Updated SQL

You MUST run the updated `CREATE_JOB_CODES_TABLE.sql` script to apply these changes:

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire `CREATE_JOB_CODES_TABLE.sql` file
4. Click "Run"

## How It Works Now

### Earnings Timeline
```
Day 1-25: Earn money → Shows in "This Month"
Day 26-31: Previous month earnings → Available in "Balance" for withdrawal
Day 1 (next month): Current month earnings → Transfer to "Balance"
```

### Task Types
- **Code Tasks**: Instant approval and earning credit
- **Image Tasks**: Code verification → Image upload → Admin review → Earning credit

### Dashboard Display
- **Today's Earning**: Approved tasks from today
- **Week's Earning**: Approved tasks from last 7 days
- **Month's Earning**: Approved tasks from current month (NOT yet in balance)
- **Balance**: Earnings from previous months (available for withdrawal 26-31)
